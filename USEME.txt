How to Run the Project:

1. Script Mode
    Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
    Locate the Archive.jar file in the res folder.
    Run the program by passing a script file as an argument: java -jar Archive.jar -file <script-path>
    Example :
            java -jar Archive.jar -file PNG/PNGscript.txt
            java -jar Archive.jar -file JPG/JPGscript.txt
            java -jar Archive.jar -file PPM/PPMscript.txt

2. Graphical User Interface (GUI Mode)
    Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
    Locate the Archive.jar file in the res folder.
    Run the JAR file without any arguments to launch the GUI-based version of the application.
    Example :
            java -jar Archive.jar

3. Interactive Mode
    Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
    Locate the Archive.jar file in the res folder.
    Example :
            java -jar Archive.jar -text
    The program will prompt you to enter commands interactively.
    Examples :
             load PNG/lion.png original
             horizontal-flip original flipped
             save PNG/Output/flipped.png flipped

Using the GUI :

1. File Operations
Load Image: Click this button to load an image from your computer. It will prompt you to
select an image file (supported formats like PNG, JPG, or PPM). Once loaded, the image will appear
in the Image Display area on the right.
Save Image: After performing operations on the image, click this button to save the modified image.
You will be prompted to specify the save location and file name.

2. Basic Operations
Select Operation: Use the dropdown to select an operation, such as Blur, Sharpen, Sepia, etc.
Split Percent: Enter a percentage (0–100) to apply the selected operation to only a part of the
image, starting from the left. If no value is provided, the operation will apply to the
whole image.
Apply: Click this button to apply the selected operation to the entire image.
Apply on Split: Click this button to apply the operation to the specified percentage of the image.

3. Flip Operations
Select Flip Operation: Use the dropdown to choose a flipping direction (e.g., Flip Horizontal or
Flip Vertical).
Flip: Click this button to apply the selected flip operation to the loaded image.

4. Brightness Adjustment
Brightness Level: Enter a numeric value to adjust the image's brightness. Positive values make the
image brighter, and negative values make it darker.
Adjust: Click this button to apply the brightness adjustment.

5. Image Compression
Threshold: Enter a value (percentage) to compress the image. Compression will
reduce the image's quality or pixel density based on this value.
Compress: Click this button to apply the compression.

6. Downscale Image
Width and Height: Enter the desired width and height for resizing the image.
Downscale: Click this button to resize the image to the specified dimensions.

7. Histogram
This section will display the histogram of the loaded or modified image.

8. Image Display Area
The central section on the right displays the loaded or processed image. After loading, any
operation you apply will reflect here.

9. Error/Status Messages
At the bottom, you’ll see messages like “Image Not Saved.” These indicate the current state,
such as whether an image is unsaved or an operation has been successfully applied.

Steps to Use:
Load an image using the Load Image button.
Select and configure the desired operation (e.g., blur, flip, brightness adjustment).
Apply the operation using the respective button (e.g., Apply, Flip, Adjust).
Save the processed image using the Save Image button.
